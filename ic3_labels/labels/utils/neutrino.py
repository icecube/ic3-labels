    The I3MCTree is traversed to find the first interaction inside the convex

    Parameters
    ----------
    frame : I3Frame
        Current I3Frame needed to retrieve I3MCTree
    primary : I3Particle
        Primary Nu Particle for which the cascade interaction is returned.
    convex_hull : scipy.spatial.ConvexHull, optional
        Defines the desired convex volume.
        If None, the IceCube detector volume is assumed.
    extend_boundary : float, optional
        Extend boundary of IceCube detector by this distance [in meters].
        This option is only used if convex_hull is None, e.g. if the IceCube
        detector is used.
    sanity_check : bool, optional
        If true, the neutrino is obtained by two different methods and cross
        checked to see if results match.

    Returns
    -------
    I3Particle, None
        Returns None if no interaction exists inside the convex hull
        Returns the found neutrino as an I3Particle.

    Raises
    ------
